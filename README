 WayPoint Premium README

- ABOUT
========
I made WayPoint in about January, 2011 and released it through CaptiveRobot with free and premium
versions. Free Edition only allowed you to save one WayPoint at a time and couldn't send WayPoint
attachments, only receive them. Since then I've started working at another company and don't have time
to maintain WayPoint, but received some great suggestions from the user community about features they
wanted to have and ways they think the product could be improved. Since I can't hope to implement the
changes myself, I've open-sourced the code and released the previously premium version for free as
just "WayPoint".

Please, feel free to make changes, improvements and modifications and I'll be happy to integrate them
into this repository and publish it to Android App Market. I'll of course add you to the contributers
list if you'd like and if your changes represent more of a fork to WayPoint, I'm happy to release your
changes as a separate product on your behalf. All work I've done is totally free and unlicensed. Take it,
make it your own, and consider giving some of it back. Thanks for your time.
